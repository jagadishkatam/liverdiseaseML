## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Data Science (DS) have been frequently interchangeably used. ML is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed.

## Data

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| eval: true
#| include: false

source('R/logisticmodel.R')
logit <- logisticmodel('data/Liver_disease_data.csv')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
head(logit$table)
```

```{r}
logit$boxplot_figure
```

```{r}
logit$barplot_figure
```

```{r}
logit$model_summary
```

```{r}
logit$accuracy
```

```{r}
logit$confusion_matrix
```

```{r}
logit$roc_curve
```

```{r}
logit$roc_curve |> plot()
```

```{r}
logit$predicted_probabilities
```
